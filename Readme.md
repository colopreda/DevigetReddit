### Assumptions made ###

- Once a post is deleted, you can't see it anymore, even if you refresh the posts
= If you are in the detail activity, and you flip your phone to landscape, you go back to the main activity with the post you were selected.
- If it takes a long time to load, it means that a lot of posts were deleted, and more are being fetched
- If you see a thumbnail, but when you enter to the detail you don't see an image, it means that the content if a gifv file, which is actually a video and not supported by any library so far
- When you tap in a thumbnail, it takes you to a post detail, and not to the full sized image, that is because it looks better in an activity with the title, and if you want to see it bigger, you can download it
